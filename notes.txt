Things I learned
-----------------
In blueprints, if you're trying to override a virtual replicated function that can only be done in C++, try creating 
your own replicated variable to override

Super:: calls in C++ is equivalent to calling "Add call to parent function" in blueprints
Dynamic Delegate in C++ is equivalent to Event Dispatchers in Blueprints

Overriding certain event delegates/dispatchers may require you to select the "component" in the object hierarchy

layers of retargeting animations

Listing out the suggested assets for future review:
1. Unity Store
2. Turbosquid
3. Epidemic Sound
4. Pond5
5. Noun Project
6. Craftpix

- Insert at index 0 of an array is pushing
- Resize is truncating
